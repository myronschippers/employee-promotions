# Employee Promotions

This is an exercise meant to be completed using a front-end framework of your choosing and state management of some kind. THe sample solution will be built out with React and Redux but there are a few other options listed below. 

## The Scenario

A company wants to streamline their promotions process to make it a little easier to determine if an employee meets all of the prerequisites for a promotion and calculate all pay increases that would be needed for the employee's promotion. They want this to be a tool that an employee can use as well in order to track their progress and motivate them to achieve more within the company. There will be 3 different users in this application; the employee, the manager, and operations. Each user is going to have a different role in the application and different tasks for them to complete. A promotion is primarily a vertical movement to the next position in the companies specific Career Track but occasionally an employee will move laterally into a new Career Track all together.
